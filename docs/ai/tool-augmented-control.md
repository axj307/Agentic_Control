# Tool-Augmented Control: Agentic AI for Spacecraft Navigation

## Overview

**Tool-Augmented Control** is an advanced AI control paradigm that bridges the gap between pure Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning and optimal control theory. Instead of having an AI directly output control commands, the system provides the AI with specialized physics-aware tools that enable sophisticated reasoning about control problems.

## Key Innovation

Traditional approaches face a fundamental tradeoff:
- **Pure LLM Control**: AI directly outputs control signals but lacks physics knowledge
- **Classical Control**: Uses optimal mathematical methods but cannot adapt to novel scenarios

**Tool-Augmented Control** achieves the best of both worlds by giving AI agents access to specialized physics tools, enabling them to:
- Reason about complex control scenarios like a human expert
- Apply mathematically rigorous physics calculations
- Adapt to new situations while maintaining optimal performance

### 6 Physics-Aware Tools

1. **Error Analysis Tool** (`analyze_errors`)
   - Computes position/velocity errors
   - Assesses control urgency and stability
   - Provides strategic recommendations

2. **Strategy Selection Tool** (`select_control_strategy`)
   - Chooses optimal control approach based on error magnitude
   - Adapts between PID, LQR, and bang-bang control
   - Provides adaptive gain recommendations

3. **PID Calculator Tool** (`calculate_pid_control`)
   - Implements classical PID control with adaptive gains
   - Provides detailed component breakdown (P, I, D terms)
   - Includes confidence assessment

4. **LQR Calculator Tool** (`calculate_lqr_control`)
   - Computes optimal Linear Quadratic Regulator control
   - Solves algebraic Riccati equation using scipy
   - Provides mathematically optimal control gains

5. **Trajectory Planner Tool** (`plan_trajectory`)
   - Plans optimal trajectories using physics-based models
   - Generates waypoints and control sequences
   - Assesses feasibility given constraints

6. **Safety Verifier Tool** (`verify_safety`)
   - Validates control actions against safety constraints
   - Predicts future states to prevent violations
   - Suggests safe control adjustments

## LangGraph Workflow

The system uses LangGraph to orchestrate tool usage through a structured workflow:

```python
# Workflow Steps
1. observe_state     → Get current spacecraft state
2. analyze_errors    → Assess control situation  
3. select_strategy   → Choose optimal approach
4. calculate_control → Compute physics-based action
5. plan_trajectory   → Verify strategy alignment
6. verify_safety     → Ensure safe operation
7. execute_action    → Output final control
```

Each step leverages specialized tools while maintaining a coherent reasoning chain that can be inspected and understood.

## Performance Results

### Double Integrator Control (Range: -1m to +1m)

| Controller Type    | Success Rate | Performance Characteristics |
|-------------------|--------------|----------------------------|
| PD Baseline       | 100% (11/11) | ✅ Robust classical control |
| Pure LQR          | 100% (11/11) | ✅ Mathematically optimal |
| **Tool-Augmented** | **100% (11/11)** | ✅ **AI matches optimal performance** |

### Key Achievement

The tool-augmented approach achieves **identical performance** to the mathematically optimal LQR controller while maintaining the adaptability and interpretability of AI reasoning.

## Technical Implementation

### Tool Integration

```python
from control_tools import get_control_tools
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph

# Get physics-aware tools
tools = get_control_tools()

# Build control graph
workflow = StateGraph(ControlState)
workflow.add_node("analyze_errors", analyze_errors_node)
workflow.add_node("select_strategy", select_strategy_node) 
workflow.add_node("calculate_control", calculate_control_node)
workflow.add_node("verify_safety", verify_safety_node)

# Define workflow edges
workflow.add_edge("analyze_errors", "select_strategy")
workflow.add_edge("select_strategy", "calculate_control")
workflow.add_edge("calculate_control", "verify_safety")
```

### Adaptive Control Strategy

The system automatically adapts its control approach based on error magnitude:

```python
def select_control_strategy(pos_error: float, vel_error: float):
    error_magnitude = sqrt(pos_error² + vel_error²)
    
    if error_magnitude >= 0.8:
        return "lqr_optimal"      # Large errors: Use LQR
    elif error_magnitude >= 0.3:
        return "adaptive_pid"     # Medium errors: Enhanced PID
    else:
        return "standard_pid"     # Small errors: Classical PID
```
