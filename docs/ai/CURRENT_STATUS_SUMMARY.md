# 🎯 Current Status Summary - Agentic Control Pipeline

**Date:** September 3, 2025  
**Status:** Production-ready with ART analysis capabilities

---

## ✅ **What's Working Right Now**

### **1. Core Experiment Pipeline**
```bash
# Run complete experiments locally
python run_experiments.py --difficulty all

# Submit to SLURM cluster
./submit_clean_experiments.sh all true
```

**Output**: Professional 4-panel plots with:
- Position trajectories over time
- Velocity trajectories over time  
- **Control actions over time** (includes control limits)
- Phase portrait (position vs velocity)

### **2. Current Performance Results**
- **PD Baseline**: 100% success, 18.7 avg steps, 73.5 avg reward
- **Tool-Augmented**: 100% success, 15.0 avg steps, 76.9 avg reward
- **Tool-Augmented Advantage**: 20% more efficient (fewer steps)

### **3. ART Analysis Pipeline**
```bash
# Run ART performance analysis
python simple_art_trainer.py

# Submit ART analysis to SLURM
./submit_art_analysis.sh
```

**What ART Analysis Provides**:
- ✅ **Reward calculation** with 4 sophisticated components
- ✅ **Performance breakdown** by scenario and controller
- ✅ **Training recommendations** with specific focus areas
- ✅ **Projected improvements** after ART training

### **4. ART Analysis Results**
**Current Analysis Shows**:
- **Reward Components**:
  - Success: 100.0 ± 0.0 (performing well)
  - Efficiency: -15.0 ± 8.6 (needs improvement) 
  - Smoothness: -0.1 ± 0.0 (needs improvement)
  - Final_Error: -8.0 ± 0.7 (needs improvement)

**Projected ART Training Results**:
- **+19.5% reward improvement** (76.9 → 91.9)
- **-8% fewer steps** (15.0 → 13.8 average)
- **+25% smoother control** actions
- **100% success rate** maintained

## 🔄 **What's Ready But Not Active**

### **Real ART Training** (`art_trainer.py`)
**Status**: Fully implemented but requires API credentials

**What it does**:
- Converts trajectories to ART training format
- Runs actual model fine-tuning with OpenAI API
- Produces improved Tool-Augmented controller

**To activate**:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
python art_trainer.py
```

---

## 📊 **Current Visualization Status**

### **Active Plots** (generated by `run_experiments.py`)
✅ **4-Panel Comparison Plot**:
1. **Position Trajectories**: Shows convergence over time
2. **Velocity Trajectories**: Shows velocity profiles  
3. **Control Actions**: Shows force commands with limits
4. **Phase Portrait**: Shows state space trajectories

**File**: `results/plots/pd_vs_tool_comparison_TIMESTAMP.png`

### **Archived Plots** (cleaned up)
❌ **Old control_analysis plots**: Removed (redundant)
✅ **Enhanced comparison plots**: Archived but available if needed
