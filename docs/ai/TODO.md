# TODO: Minimal Double Integrator Implementation

## Current Status: 🟡 Phase 1 in Progress

## 📋 Current Status: Ready for Testing & Implementation

### ✅ COMPLETED (Ready to Test)
- [x] Project structure created
- [x] Double integrator environment implemented
- [x] Physics verification tests created
- [x] Visualization tools implemented  
- [x] Mock LLM controller created
- [x] PD controller baseline established
- [x] Requirements.txt setup

### 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS
1. **Test current implementation**:
   ```bash
   cd 01_basic_physics && python test_environment.py
   cd ../02_direct_control && python simple_controller.py
   ```

2. **Connect to real LLM** (vLLM or OpenAI)
3. **Implement LangGraph tools** for tool-augmented control
4. **Compare approaches** on same scenarios
5. **Add ART training pipeline**

### 📖 DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE
👉 **See `DETAILED_TODO.md` for complete implementation guide with:**
- Step-by-step code templates
- Exact commands to run
- Troubleshooting guide
- Success criteria
- 4-week timeline

### ⚡ READY TO RUN ART TRAINING!

✅ **Complete ART training pipeline implemented**
- Direct control approach with trajectory collection  
- Tool-augmented control with physics reasoning
- GRPO training integration using existing ART library
- Performance comparison and evaluation

### 🚀 RUN TRAINING NOW:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start vLLM server (if not running)
conda activate agentic_control
vllm serve Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct --port 8000

# Terminal 2: Run complete training pipeline  
conda activate agentic_control
cd 05_training
python run_training.py
```

Expected runtime: 10-15 minutes
Expected results: Tool-augmented approach outperforms direct control

### 📋 NEXT EXTENSIONS:
1. **Real LangGraph Integration**: Connect to actual tools in `03_langgraph_tools/`
2. **Aerospace Systems**: Extend to spacecraft attitude control
3. **Advanced Training**: Longer episodes, more scenarios, curriculum learning

### 🔍 QUICK TESTS:
```bash
# Verify existing components
python 01_basic_physics/test_environment.py   # ✅ Physics working
python 02_direct_control/simple_controller.py # ✅ Mock LLM working  

# Test ART integration
python 05_training/art_integration.py         # Test imports and setup
```

## Key Questions to Answer

- How much better is tool-augmented control vs direct LLM control?
- Can we see interpretable reasoning in the tool-augmented approach?
- How does training improve both approaches?
- Which approach transfers better to aerospace problems?

## Success Criteria

✅ **Phase 1**: Physics simulation works correctly  
✅ **Phase 2**: Direct LLM can control double integrator to target  
✅ **Phase 3**: Tool-augmented control outperforms direct approach  
✅ **Phase 4**: Clear performance/interpretability comparison  
✅ **Phase 5**: Training improves both approaches significantly
